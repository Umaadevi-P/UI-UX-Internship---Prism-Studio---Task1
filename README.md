# UX-Task 1
Submission for PrismStudio Internship – UX Research Task 1

Created by: Umaadevi P

Date: July 2025


# Objective 🎯
Design two detailed user personas backed by user research
→ Build shared empathy maps and journey flows
→ Extract insights to identify pain points, needs, and opportunities
→ Lay the foundation for future solution ideation


# Research Process 📝
I conducted a short survey using Google Forms and gathered responses from college students across disciplines. Based on their inputs, I created two fictionalized personas grounded in real behaviors, needs, and frustrations.
I aimed for a tone that’s both relatable and thoughtful — because real users aren't just data points; they have stories.

# Remark
This project helped me experience the role of a real UX researcher — starting from raw data, feeling user emotions, and translating them into useful design assets. Everything visualized here is grounded in the voices of real users (even if some characters are fictionalized).

Next step: Wireframes! 🚀
